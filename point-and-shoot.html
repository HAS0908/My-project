        <p>The point-and-shoot camera, also called the compact camera, is a small, pocketable camera intended for quick shooting. Point-and-shoot cameras do not much knowledge or technique to use; thus being a good option for any kind of user who wants to take photos with minimal complications. Equipped with preset settings and automatic focusing, with flash-perfect in spontaneous shots where there is no need to change settings manually. Since the popularization of social media within the past couple of years, point-and-shoot cameras have been back in the market for their unique retro look and professional output that the cameras on the phone just cannot compete with.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of the major reasons to love a point-and-shoot camera is because of its portability and ease of use. They tend to be lighter and less bulky compared to big digital cameras. Due to many of their features being automatic, literally anyone can take good-quality photographs without any learning curve at all. Yet another plus for them is the fact that, notwithstanding the small size, the image quality of point-and-shoots can be higher and have greater optical zoom compared to many smartphone cameras: sharper and more detailed photos, especially when the light gets low. General disadvantages of point-and-shoot cameras concern limited manual controls, which raises frustration if users want to be creative with them. Besides, some of them lack high-end advanced features, such as interchangeable lenses, and hence are limited in comparison with DSLRs and mirrorless cameras.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These cameras would be quite appropriate for casual photographers, travelers, and those on social media who want great photos without complicated handling. With social media resurging their popularity, many are adopting point-and-shoot cameras over smartphones due to the aesthetic they provide-one truly unique and standing out from digital feeds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Popular Camera's I'd recommend are the Sony RX100 Series, Nikon Coolpix series, and the Canon G7X mark ii or iii</p>
